While using an Android phone you can ouput things to the adb console with:

Debug.Log("Whatever you want to say")

Then, to see the logs in your terminal:

adb logcat

But that outputs a lot of things that we don't want. So a way to go is to run the following command:

adb logcat -v time | python logcat_unity.py

where you can find logcat_unity.py in this directory.
