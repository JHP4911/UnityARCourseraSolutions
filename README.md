# Handheld AR App Development with Unity - Partial solutions

While I was doing the Handheld AR App Development with Unity course at Coursera I though that it should be a major roadblock for all the newbies. The course assumes that you already have experience developing with Unity and an intermediate to expert knowledge of scripting using C#, which other student and myself didn't have. That is why I decided to create this repository to post partial solutions and tips to things I got stuck. This way, everyone can finish the course.
