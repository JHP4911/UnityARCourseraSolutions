# Handheld AR App Development with Unity - Partial solutions

While I was doing the [Handheld AR App Development with Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/handheld-ar/) course at Coursera I though that it should be a major roadblock for all the newbies. The course assumes that you already have experience developing with Unity and an intermediate to expert knowledge of scripting using C#, which other student and myself didn't have. That is why I created this repository to post partial solutions and tips to things I got stuck. This way, all the newbies can finish the course. 

Feel free to contribute and **star the project if it helped you**! ðŸŽ“
